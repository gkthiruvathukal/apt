simple.ast is a description of an FSA to support input tokens similar to
those found in languages like Perl, Icon, and Python. (Comment lines 
begin with "#", which is the major difference.

test1.data and test2.data are sample input files. You can use these to see
the tokens printed one by one.

To run, here is all you need to do:

1. Recompile everything. Best way to do that:
   javac *.java org/jhpc/apt/*.java

2. Run TestScannerSimple with the test cases.
   java TestScannerSimple test1.data
   java TestScannerSimple test2.data
   

Note: ScannerSimple is a generated file. It makes use of the Apt Scanning
Library, which was ported to Java by George T. on July 31, 1999. This library
can be studied in subdirectory org/jhpc/apt.

Good luck.
George
